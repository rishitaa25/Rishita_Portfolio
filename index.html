        <h3>Data Analysis and Visualization of Naming Trends</h3>
        <p>
            This project focused on analyzing name trends using programming and data analysis. The goal was to extract insights from large datasets 
            to understand patterns in naming conventions over time. Through this, I developed skills in data visualization, Python programming, and 
            working with large datasets efficiently. This project is valuable beyond the classroom as it helps in demographic studies, market research, 
            and understanding societal trends through data-driven insights.

        <h3>Embedded Systems Development with Microcontrollers</h3>
        <p>
            As part of CPRE 1860, I worked on a hands-on hardware and software integration project, where I built a functional embedded system. 
            The objective was to design, program, and test a microcontroller-based system to solve a real-world problem. This project
